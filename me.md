<p>Hi, I’m Sam. I’m currently a second year at UC Berkeley pursuing a BA in Computer Science.
</p>

<p>I come from a long line of sassy Vietnamese chefs; I am neither sassy nor a good cook. Once, I tried to make pasta and forgot to add water - the noodles burned. Nonetheless, these far from tasty noodles work in tandem with my life and have become the seeds of my world. These burnt noodles are the disparaging foundation I habitually build upon, originating from my aspiring chef de cuisine days when nine year old me fathomed that there's always room to grow. </p>

<p>I have explored and learned, and have since discovered that I thrive the most when I’m trying new things. I love going to places I’ve never been before, finding little hidden food joints, and reading new books. DIY projects are one of my favorite things to do on the side, whenever I can find the time to do so. When taking some TLC time, I indulge in my favorite TV shows- Suits, Narcos, Sherlock, anything with an intense storyline, drama and of course some humor, likely has my attention. </p>
