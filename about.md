<p>Hi, I’m Sam. I’m currently a fourth year at UC Berkeley pursuing a BA in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
</p>

<p>My past experience from my internship at Intel Corporation taught me the significance Computer Science has in both making the world a more efficient place and, as a whole, meeting the demanding needs of society with newfound thoughts, ideas, and implementations. Cognitive Science allows me to delve deeper into the meaning of what we're doing and what kind of sociological impact we can have. </p>

<p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading, sewing, DIY projects, and most importantly, just trying new things. When taking some TLC time, I indulge in my favorite TV shows- Suits, Narcos, Sherlock, anything with an intense storyline, drama and of course some humor, likely has my attention. </p>
