<p>Hi, I’m Sam. I’m currently a second year at UC Berkeley pursuing a BA in Computer Science.
</p>

<p>I come from a long line of sassy Vietnamese chefs; I am neither sassy nor a good cook. Once, I tried to make pasta and forgot to add water - the noodles burned. Nonetheless, these far from tasty noodles work in tandem with my life and have become the seeds of my world. These burnt noodles are the disparaging foundation I habitually build upon, originating from my aspiring chef de cuisine days when nine year old me fathomed that there's always room to grow. </p>

<p>I have explored and learned, and have since discovered that I thrive the most when I’m trying new things. Born and raised in San Jose, California, I have immersed myself in the treasures of the Silicon Valley, from technology to culture, the diversity of this area is beautiful. I love going to places I’ve never been before, finding little hidden food joints, and reading new books. DIY projects are one of my favorite things to do on the side, whenever I can find the time to do so. When taking some TLC time, I indulge in my favorite TV shows- Suits, Narcos, Sherlock, anything with an intense storyline, drama and of course some humor, likely has my attention. </p>

<p>I also believe that there is so much to be learned in this world, and everybody deserves a chance to see all that there is out there. I participate and am an intern for Let’s Rise mentorship, an organization that mentors underrepresented youth from the Richmond community. This experience continuously allows me to connect with students who are often doubtful of their abilities to pursue higher education, and guide them toward a positive track. I find teaching to be a heartwarming experience, and this includes my time at Girls Who Code. These young girls with such a passion to learn and churn out projects from code, is an inspiration to me, as opposed to when I see the vast gender disparities in my very own UC Berkeley classes. Together, the community can grow and thrive in our commitment to learning. </p>
